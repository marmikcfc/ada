## Architecture Explanation for LLM: Dynamic MCP Server Hosting Platform

Below is a detailed architecture and workflow for a system that allows users to upload MCP OpenAPI specifications, queues and processes them, spins up local MCP server instances, tracks their ports, and provides a clear path for deploying to Cloudflare.

### **System Overview**

- **FastAPI** backend provides an endpoint for users to upload their MCP OpenAPI specification.
- On upload, the spec is enqueued for processing.
- A worker process dequeues jobs, generates and launches an MCP server (e.g., using `openapi-to-mcp` or similar tools) on a dynamically assigned local port.
- The system maintains a registry of which MCP server is running on which port.
- Documentation and scripts are included for deploying the MCP server to Cloudflare Workers for production use.

## **Step-by-Step Workflow**

### **1. FastAPI Upload Endpoint**

- **Endpoint:** `/upload-openapi`
- **Function:** Accepts OpenAPI spec files (JSON/YAML), validates input, and enqueues a job.

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI, UploadFile, File
from queue import Queue

app = FastAPI()
job_queue = Queue()

@app.post("/upload-openapi")
async def upload_openapi(file: UploadFile = File(...)):
    content = await file.read()
    # Validate and parse OpenAPI spec here
    job_queue.put(content)
    return {"status": "enqueued"}
```

### **2. Job Queue and Worker**

- **Purpose:** Decouples upload from processing.
- **Worker:** Continuously consumes jobs, generates MCP server code, assigns an available port, and launches the server.

```python
import subprocess
import socket

mcp_servers = {}  # {port: process}

def find_free_port():
    sock = socket.socket()
    sock.bind(('', 0))
    port = sock.getsockname()[1]
    sock.close()
    return port

def worker():
    while True:
        openapi_spec = job_queue.get()
        port = find_free_port()
        # Generate MCP server code from the OpenAPI spec (e.g., using openapi-to-mcp)
        # Save to a temp directory, then launch:
        proc = subprocess.Popen(["node", "generated-mcp-server/index.js", "--port", str(port)])
        mcp_servers[port] = proc
        print(f"MCP server running on port {port}")
```

### **3. MCP Server Registry**

- **Purpose:** Maintains a mapping of active MCP servers and their ports.
- **API:** Optionally, expose a `/servers` endpoint to list all running MCP servers and their ports.

```python
@app.get("/servers")
def list_servers():
    return [{"port": port, "pid": proc.pid} for port, proc in mcp_servers.items()]
```

### **4. Documentation: Deploying MCP Server to Cloudflare**

#### **A. Prepare Your MCP Server for Cloudflare**

- Ensure your server code is stateless (use Cloudflare KV/Durable Objects for state).
- Refactor as needed for compatibility with Cloudflare Workers.

#### **B. Initialize Cloudflare Worker Project**

```shell
npx create-cloudflare@latest mcp-demo
# Choose "Hello World Example" and TypeScript
cd mcp-demo
npx workers-mcp setup
```

#### **C. Deploy to Cloudflare**

```shell
npx wrangler@latest deploy
```
- Your MCP server will be live at:  
  `https://..workers.dev/sse`

#### **D. (Optional) Secure with Auth0**

- Set up Auth0 as described in [Cloudflare documentation][4].
- Store secrets using Wrangler:
  ```shell
  wrangler secret put AUTH0_DOMAIN
  wrangler secret put AUTH0_CLIENT_ID
  wrangler secret put AUTH0_CLIENT_SECRET
  wrangler secret put AUTH0_AUDIENCE
  wrangler secret put AUTH0_SCOPE
  wrangler secret put API_BASE_URL
  ```
- Update callback URLs as needed.

#### **E. Connect and Test**

- Use MCP Inspector or any compatible MCP client to connect to your deployed server.

| MCP Registry      | Python dict/API   | Track running servers and ports          |
| Deployment        | Cloudflare Worker | Production hosting and scaling           |
