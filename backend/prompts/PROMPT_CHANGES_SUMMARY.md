# Prompt Changes Summary - Three-Stage Architecture

## Overview
The system now follows a clear three-stage architecture where each component has a specific, focused responsibility:

1. **Voice Agent** - Minimal acknowledgment only
2. **Enhancement Agent (MCP)** - Tool execution and workflow orchestration
3. **Visualization Processor** - Visual presentation of enhanced data

## Changes Made

### 1. Voice Agent (`voice_agent_system.txt`)
**Previous Role**: Full conversational assistant with detailed responses
**New Role**: MINIMAL voice response initiator

Key Changes:
- Reduced to 1-2 sentence acknowledgments only
- No detailed information or explanations
- No mention of specific tools or capabilities
- Acts like a "receptionist" transferring to an expert
- Response patterns:
  - Greetings: "Hello! Let me help you with that."
  - Questions: "I'll look that up for you."
  - Requests: "I'll help you with that right away."
  - Complex queries: "Great question! Let me gather that information."

### 2. Enhancement Agent (`mcp_agent_prompt.txt`)
**Previous Role**: Analyze voice responses and enhance them
**New Role**: Execute workflows and determine if enhancement adds value

Key Changes:
- Now responsible for ALL actual work (tools, data gathering)
- Executes multi-step workflows
- Makes enhancement decisions based on value addition AND user intent
- **NEW: User Intent Recognition**:
  - If user asks to "show", "display", "list", "visualize", "format" → ALWAYS enhance
  - Format requests override simple enhancement rules
  - Even without tools, enhance if user requests specific presentation
- **NEW: Downstream Awareness**:
  - Understands visualization processor capabilities (cards, tables, charts, etc.)
  - Structures enhanced text to hint at appropriate visualizations
  - Uses markdown formatting to guide visual presentation
- Enhancement matrix updated:
  - User requests format/visualization → enhance = true (highest priority)
  - Used tools successfully → enhance = true
  - Retrieved structured data → enhance = true
  - Simple facts without format request → enhance = false
  - No tools needed/used → enhance = false
  - Tools failed → enhance = false
- Voice-over limited to 1-2 sentences summarizing findings

### 3. Visualization Processor (`visualization_system_prompt.txt`)
**Previous Role**: Transform assistant replies into UI
**New Role**: Transform MCP agent's enhanced data into optimal visual presentation

Key Changes:
- Now explicitly the FINAL step in the pipeline
- Receives pre-processed data from MCP agent
- Focuses on HOW to display, not WHAT to display
- Makes data actionable and explorable
- Component selection based on data structure

## Example Flows

### Example 1: Basic Weather Query
**User**: "What's the weather in Paris?"

1. **Voice Agent**: "Let me check that for you." (immediate response)

2. **MCP Agent**: 
   - Calls weather API tool
   - Gets: {"temp": 21, "condition": "Partly cloudy", "humidity": 65}
   - Decides: enhance = true (structured data from tools)
   - Provides: enhanced text with weather data
   - Voice-over: "It's 21 degrees and partly cloudy in Paris."

3. **Visualization Processor**:
   - Receives the weather data
   - Creates a Card with temperature, condition icon, humidity gauge
   - Makes it interactive (refresh button, forecast link)

### Example 2: Format Request (NEW BEHAVIOR)
**User**: "Show me the weather in Paris in a nice format"

1. **Voice Agent**: "Let me display that for you." (immediate response)

2. **MCP Agent**: 
   - Recognizes "show me" and "format" keywords
   - Calls weather API tool
   - Gets: {"temp": 21, "condition": "Partly cloudy", "humidity": 65}
   - Decides: enhance = true (USER REQUESTED DISPLAY - highest priority)
   - Provides: enhanced text with rich formatting hints
   - Voice-over: "Here's the Paris weather displayed in a formatted view."

3. **Visualization Processor**:
   - Receives formatted markdown with structure hints
   - Creates an enhanced Card with visual elements
   - Adds charts for forecast trends if available

### Example 3: Simple Fact Without Format Request (NO ENHANCEMENT)
**User**: "What's 2 + 2?"

1. **Voice Agent**: "Let me calculate that." (immediate response)

2. **MCP Agent**: 
   - Calls calculator tool
   - Gets: 4
   - No format request detected
   - Decides: enhance = false (simple fact, no visualization requested)
   - Voice-over: ""

3. **Visualization Processor**:
   - Not invoked since enhance = false
   - User only hears voice response

### Example 4: List Request Without Tools (STILL ENHANCED)
**User**: "List the days of the week"

1. **Voice Agent**: "I'll list those for you." (immediate response)

2. **MCP Agent**: 
   - Recognizes "list" keyword - user wants visual presentation
   - No tools needed (knowledge-based)
   - Decides: enhance = true (USER REQUESTED LIST FORMAT)
   - Provides: "## Days of the Week\n\n1. Monday\n2. Tuesday\n3. Wednesday..."
   - Voice-over: "Here are the seven days of the week."

3. **Visualization Processor**:
   - Receives markdown list
   - Creates a formatted list or card display
   - May add calendar context or navigation

## Benefits of This Architecture

1. **Faster perceived response**: Voice acknowledgment is immediate
2. **Clear separation of concerns**: Each component has one job
3. **Better scalability**: Can upgrade each component independently
4. **Reduced redundancy**: No duplicate processing or responses
5. **Optimal user experience**: Voice for speed, visuals for depth

## Implementation Notes

- Voice agent should NEVER wait for enhancement results
- MCP agent should ALWAYS use tools when they add value
- Visualization processor should ALWAYS make data interactive
- Voice-over should NEVER duplicate the initial acknowledgment
